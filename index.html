        <h3 id="how_they_met">How did they meet each other?</h3>

        <p><span class="red-text">Kurt Cobain</span> and <span class="red-text">Courtney Love</span> met in 1990, at a club called the
        Satyricon in Portland, Oregon. Nirvana were performing that night.
        As Kurt walked past Courtney that night, she called out to him, "You
        look like Dave Pirner" (the singer of Soul Asylum). She meant it as a
        half insult and half flirt.</p>

        <p>Kurt decided to flirt back but in his own non-conventional way
        which was by grabbing her and wrestling her to the ground. This
        strange gesture nevertheless won her heart. Afer he helped her back up,
        he offered her a sticker of a cartoon monkey called Chim Chim, which
        she later put on her guitar case.</p>

        <p>At the end of that year, upon finding out that he was newly single,
        Courtney sent Kurt a gift. It was a heart shaped box filled with
        trinkets such as a mini teacup, seashells,
        dried roses and a tiny porcelain doll. She dabbed the box with her
        perfume before mailing it off to him.</p>

        <h3 id="marriage">Their marriage</h3>

        <p>The couple had their wedding on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii at sunset
        on the 24th of February 1992. Due to their intense schedule, there
        was not much opportunity for planning an elaborate wedding ceremony.
        There were only eight guests present. Notably, none of Kurt's nor
        Courtney's family were in attendance.</p>

        <p>On the day Courtney wore an antique silk
        dress formerly owned by the actor Frances Farmer. Kurt famously wore
        his pyjamas. Some people might interpret this lack of attention put
        into his appearance as an indication that the marriage did not mean
        much to him, but this could not be further from the truth. During the
        wedding, he cried.</p>

        <h3 id="family">Their family</h3>

        <p>Kurt and Courtney had one child: a baby girl named Frances Bean
        Cobain. She was born on the 18th of August 1992. The couple had always
        wanted to start a family and Courtney insists that if they'd had more
        time then would definitely have had more children.</p>

        <p>In December 1994, she recounted an oddly macabre memory which tells
        a story of a young couple who are eagerly yearning to pursue
        parenthood together despite all the challenges facing them. Courtney
        recalled: "[w]hen we decided we were in love at the Beverly Garland Hotel,
        we found this dead bird. Took out three feathers. And he said, “This is
        for you, this is for me, and this is for our baby we’re gonna have.”</p>

        <h3 id="writings">Artistic expressions of their love</h3>

        <p><strong>Writings by Kurt:</strong></p>

        <p>"She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak/I've been locked inside
        your heart shaped box four whole weeks." (from the song <em>Heart Shaped
        Box</em> by Nirvana)</p>

        <p>"[After recounting a number of recent fulfilling experiences] While
          all these things were very special, none were half as
          rewarding as having a baby with a person who is the supreme example
          of dignity, ethics and honesty" (excerpt of the liner notes of
          <em>Incesticide</em></p>

        <p>"Courtney, when I say I love you I am not ashamed, nor will anyone
          ever ever come close to intimidating, persuading me, etc into
          thinking otherwise. I wear you on my sleeve. I spread you out wide
          open with the wingspan of a peacock." (excerpt of a letter)</p>

        <p><strong>Writings by Courtney:</strong></p>

        <p>"To Kurt Cobain: I want to be somewhere above you with all the
          candy in my hands. You smell like waffles and milk. Kim said we were
          the hottest rock couple since Sean and Madonna. Acne superstar.
          Spill ice cream down my dress with your eyes wide open and be my
          best girlfriend. I love and miss your body and you." (excerpt of a letter)</p>

        <p>"I am doll parts, bad skin, doll hearts, it stands for knife for the
          rest of my life, peel my little heart off and soak it in your left
          hand and call me tonight." (excerpt of a letter)</p>

        <p>"Put me up above the boy/The one I love I should destroy" (from
          song <em>Hit So Hard</em> by Hole)</p>

        <p>"Live through this with me I swear that I would die for you and if
        you live through this with me I swear that I would die for you." (from
        the song <em>Asking For it</em> by Hole)</p>
